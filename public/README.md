I want to have a menu bar in the bottom of the screen, and a info bar in the top
The info bar should show the players stats, total units, total gold, total steel, total ammunition. the players username, the current time, if the player is in any alliances.
The menu bar should have a create unit button, a trade button.
And when a unit is selected there shoud be a small info panel in the top left, just under the info bar, that shows the health of the unit, its current travelling time if it is travelling and its current location.
When the unit is selected there should also be a move button in the menu bar that makes the unit start travelling towards a selected point, travel time should depend on the lenght of travel, with travel over water/ocean taking double the time that travelling over land does, and travelling over enemy terretory takes 3 times the amount of time.
